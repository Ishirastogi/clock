# Clock Project

This project is a simple clock implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The clock displays the current time and updates in real-time.

## Features

- Displays the current time with hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates the time automatically every second.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Code Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the web page and includes the JavaScript and CSS files.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for updating the clock.

- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styling for the clock.

## How It Works

The clock project uses JavaScript's `Date` object to get the current time. It retrieves the hours, minutes, and seconds from the `Date` object and updates the corresponding elements in the HTML to display the time.
